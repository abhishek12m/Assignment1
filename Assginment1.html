    <p>Front end development is everything involved in the programming the user interface of a web application. Typically it refers tp the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Casscading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript portion of website production as opposed to the database or server-side programming. It encompasses everything from building a simple HTML text, to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various different browsers, and screen sizes.</p>

    <p>Back-end Development refers to the server side of development where you are primarily focused on how the site works. This type of web development usually consists of three parts: a server, an application, and a database. Code written by back end developers is what communicates the database information to the browser.</p>
